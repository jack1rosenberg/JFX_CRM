This zip file contains my Computer Science 2 IA, an Auto Detailing CRM for 
the use of my business. It also includes the JavaFX library, 
which is called by both run-app files. This run script I found to be the easiest 
way to export the project for use. 

**Requires: 
     Java



Windows:
     - Run with run-app.bat


Linux:
     - Run with run-app.sh
